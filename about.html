<p>My name is Oliver and I have always been curious about how things work. As far back as I can remember, I've been taking things apart and putting them back together. That led me to learn HTML and CSS before I entered high school. Fast forward to 2020: I'm chasing a dream and allowing myself the opportunity to pursue an education and career in a topic I'm passionate about. Software has always been a major part of my life, from toys and games I played with growing up, to Microsoft Office and iTunes I used throughout my educational years, to software installed in my vehicle and the app I help support at my current employer. The advances we have made within the last 20-30 years has been incredible, and we've only just begun. I'm excited to be getting involved in a field that has endless amounts of learning opportunities ahead. Aside from tech, I love animals, music, the outdoors, and fitness. </p>
