<p>My name is Oliver, and curiosity has driven me for my entire life.
<p>
<p>I've often wondered what I should do for a career. Many topics fascinate me, so it's been a tough call until recently. I reunited with a friend from years ago, who happened to also be a former supervisor. She had told me about her experience finding a coding bootcamp and encouraged me to check it out. Some of my favorite memories from when I was younger came back to me as I started diving back into learning code before applying for the bootcamp.

<p>When I was a small child, I remember getting my hands on a screwdriver and taking everything I could get my hands on apart. I broke a lot of my favorite electronic toys doing this. But then Myspace came about, which led me to start teaching myself how to code. That was before I understood exactly what code was. I discovered how to view the page source thanks to <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>, which is still to this day one of my favorite browsers to use. When I entered college, I took my first HTML course and ended up bored because I had already learned the majority of what we were learning. Looking back, I feel like I should have tried testing out of it so I could've moved on to more interesting aspects of development.

<p>I got my first smartphone at, what I consider to be, a late age. I think I was 19 or 20 when I got an Android. I loved how I was able to customize how my homescreen looked but then I discovered the iPhone. Since the 5c, I haven't looked back. There have been many things I've missed about Android, but Apple's iOS 14 beta has impressed me the most since my switch (if you haven't installed the beta, just wait). I've been helping test some betas for a few years now: <b>iOS, Spotify, some 3rd party apps/widgets, and even a couple Android verisons of the app my employer's developer has created</b>. I started working at a credit union earlier this year, and when I was hired, I was not expecting to be thrown into online banking. When I was told I'd be helping with it, I got super excited. Working with our app (and website) has made me become even more passionate about development. We've had some UX issues and a good number of bugs that were released into the production stage, which I've been able to help resolve.

<p>Aside from growing up with computers and other tech, I've always wanted to dive into a field where I would have endless amounts of learning. The tech field in general supplies this, but software development alone has my interest more than any other part of the industry. Software has helped make our lives easier, it's supplied us with tools we use every single day, it's helped us stay in touch with our loved ones while being hundreds (if not thousands) of miles apart, and has even helped save lives. Ongoing learning is only one aspect of software that has me captivated. The fact that software can impact lives positively in a multitude of ways also has me excited about it.
